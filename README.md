# ⚙️ How the Game Works

### 🎮 Core Components

## 1️⃣ Game Loop
The game runs using a continuous loop that:

- Processes player input
- Updates game state
- Detects collisions
- Repaints the screen
- Maintains consistent frame updates

## 2️⃣ Player System

- Keyboard-based movement
- Position tracking (x, y coordinates)
- Sprite updates (if implemented)
- Collision boundaries

## 3️⃣ Collision Detection

- Prevents movement through walls/objects
- Detects interactions between player and environment
- Ensures game rules are enforced

## 4️⃣ Rendering System

- Uses Java graphics rendering
- Draws tiles, player, and game objects
- Updates screen in real-time

# 🎮 Gameplay Features

- 🕹 Player-controlled movement
- 🧱 Environment boundaries
- 🔄 Continuous real-time gameplay
- 🎯 Basic game objective (if implemented)
- ⚡ Responsive keyboard input
